      "Coronavirus lockdowns have forced giants such as Primark, H&M, and Zara-owner Inditex to shut down thousands of shops and cancel orders worth millions of dollars. In the coming months, the fashion industry will face a “Darwinian shakeout” that will put 80% of companies in Europe and the U.S. in financial distress, according to a Mckinsey report from April. Yet one corner of the market is thriving. \n “We are doing better this month than we did during Christmas,” says Cora Hilts, founder and chief executive officer at Reve en Vert, a platform selling luxury fashion focused on sustainability. “People are shopping more online and have more time to make conscious decisions. Our designers have greater control over the supply chain because it’s very difficult to produce abroad and be sustainable.”",
      "Higher prices and smaller scale have traditionally kept sustainable fashion brands outside the mainstream. Now these same attributes might save them from the wave of consolidation and insolvencies that’s coming for fast fashion behemoths and luxury household brands.",
      "Large retailers source textiles to third parties in developing nations such as China, Vietnam or Bangladesh, says Kirsi Niinimaki, a design professor at Aalto University in Finland. These elements are often made by under-paid workers operating old, energy-intensive machinery, treated with polluting chemicals banned in developed countries. \n “Shorter supply chains allow for more transparency,” Niinimaki says. “For most brands we still don’t know where things are produced, using which chemicals and what waste comes out. That’s quite problematic.”",
      "Niinimaki co-authored a scientific review published in Nature earlier this year showing that the sector produces around 20% of the world’s wastewater—mainly through treating or dyeing fabric—and the plastic microfibers used in many garments release the equivalent of 50 billion plastic bottles into the oceans each year. The rise of fast fashion, which depends on shoppers buying cheap items frequently, only makes things worse. At a time when even oil majors are trying to cut greenhouse gas emissions, those from the fashion industry are expected to surge by more than 50% by 2030. The solution is to transition to a “slow fashion” model, the review concluded."

      "The Covid-19 pandemic is exposing deep flaws in the economic model that both encourages and exploits migrant labor. Too many rich countries are dependent on low-cost workers, and too many poor communities are over-reliant on the money sent home for food, shelter and education.\n Remittances to low and middle income countries will drop by a fifth this year to $445 billion, according to a recent World Bank report. That’s the worst slide in decades and a sharp turnaround from last year’s increase to a record $554 billion, which exceeded foreign direct investment in these destinations. The lender forecasts a slide of 22% in South Asia, where funds are largely bound for India and Pakistan. The Philippines, which gets 10% of its gross domestic product from such payments, could see a decline of 13%.",
      "Waiting for paychecks from mothers, fathers, uncles and aunts abroad is an existential concern for those left at home. The faltering flow of cash is likely to mean less money is available for basic needs, especially medical care. In the Philippines, an entire ecosystem is supported by people overseas, be they maids and nannies in Singapore and Hong Kong, energy and construction workers in the Persian Gulf, or seafarers around the world. Filipinos make up about a quarter of merchant-marine staff. More than 10 million citizens, or about 9% of the population, are employed abroad at any given time.",
      "The pandemic is producing a triple-whammy for migrants: They can’t work, they can’t go home (with airlines grounded) and they stand a greater risk of infection by staying put in their densely packed urban quarters. The bulk of Singapore’s recent surge in cases comes from dormitories built for 200,000-plus foreign laborers. In the Middle East, long a source of remittances for many parts of Asia, living conditions have been criticized as substandard. \n For host countries including Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, leaning on migrant workers to handle the nuts and bolts of the economy is an uncomfortable byproduct of prosperity. Low fertility rates combined with graying populations has created labor shortages in the wealthiest societies. That leaves foreigners to build the gleaming towers and execute trendy home makeovers, staff hotels, busboy restaurants and maintain public transport."

      "SoftBank Group Corp. forecast a wider net loss for the fiscal year ended in March, adding 150 billion yen ($1.4 billion) to its prediction from just two weeks ago because of deeper difficulties at the office-sharing startup WeWork. \n The Japanese company said it now expects to lose 900 billion yen, after estimating previously its net loss would total about 750 billion. The hit related to WeWork accounts for about 700 billion yen of the non-operating losses, including investments and loan commitments. The Tokyo-based company bailed out WeWork last year after its failed stock offering and has since taken control of the business.",
      "SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son has been struggling with the impact of the coronavirus on the portfolio of startups he has backed in recent years. Companies such as Brandless Inc. have shut down, while satellite operator OneWeb filed for bankruptcy last month. SoftBank is writing down the value of investments made through its $100 billion Vision Fund and on its own. \n Son bet heavily on the so-called sharing economy, in which startups help people split the use of cars, offices and homes. Those businesses, already struggling with high operational costs, have been hammered by the pandemic that has discouraged much direct human interaction. \n “Son is getting the bad news out there,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners. “Everyone is looking forward to a lifting of lock-downs and easing back to normality.” \n ",
      "SoftBank Forecasts Record Losses as Startup Bets Backfire \n SoftBank is scheduled to report final earnings for the fiscal year on May 18. SoftBank shares were little changed in Tokyo trading, while the Japanese stock market rose. \n SoftBank last month boosted the size of a planned share repurchase to 2.5 trillion yen. That has lifted shares that had fallen about 50% from their peak earlier in the year. \n The company kept its full-year outlook for a 1.35 trillion yen operating loss unchanged.\n “The impression is that they are being more aggressive in including WeWork-related losses,” said Shinji Moriyuki, an analyst at SBI Securities. “That should help reduce risk further down the road.” \n ",
      "Last year, after WeWork’s effort to go public fell apart, SoftBank stepped in to organize a $9.5 billion bailout and put its own chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, in charge of turning around the business. Earlier this year, the Japanese company scrapped one part of the agreement -- to buy $3 billion of shares from existing shareholders, including former Chief Executive Officer Adam Neumann."
